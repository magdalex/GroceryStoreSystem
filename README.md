# GroceryStoreSystem
- GroceryStoreSystemERD.vsdx is a visio file that can be opened in microsoft office 360 (online. you can use omnivox account to use visio for free)
- mssql dependency needs to be added to the project if you're not using vscode.
- .vscode folder contains dependency settings so that they are added automatically when the project is opened in vscode
- the sql server curently requires adding client IP addresses to a whitelist. the GroceryStoreSystem wont work if this isn't done.
